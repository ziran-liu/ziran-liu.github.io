I just graduated with a Ph.D. degree in Operations Research (OR) from New York University, Stern School of Business, with sepcialization in probability theory and  scochasic processes. Upon my graduation of Ph.D, I got invited by the office of academic affairs at NYU Stern to the Beta Gamma Sigma (NYU Stern Chapter) with their invitation message of "outstanding scholastic performance".

I am also on the job market now.

My Ph.D. research was motivated by queueing theory in Operations Research, but it revolves around probability theory/stochastic processes and related to differential geometry. From an applied perspective, my  Ph.D. research applies to Operations Research, Machine Learning/Deep Learning. 

Mathematically, the center of my Ph.D. training is in probability theory, with its applications in Operations Research (OR); with courses taken on both of the track for Ph.D. in probablity at NYU Courant and the  track for Ph.D. in OR at NYU Stern. Probability theory goes thuough my research interests, but I am also driven to uncover the hidden connections and from the robaability theory to other diciplines; as well as the mathematical principles hidden behind many exciting work in other fields in the applied research, for which my aim is to provide solutions or theory on the fundamental level to  understand the observed phenomenon in the reserach of applied sciences, by leveraging the tools including the (broad) probability theory, stochastic processes, and methods of global analysis on manifolds.

My training background is, Ph.D. in OR, specialized in probability theory (New York University, United States); M.S. in mathematical sciences, specialized in probability theory (New York University, United States); M.S. in mathematical sciences, specialized in differential geometry-global analysis on manifold (Nankai University, China); B.S. in pure mathematics (Nankai University, China).

If you have similar research interests/motivation including but not limitied to probability theory, differential geometry methods, and their applications, you can reach out to me. For any questions or comments, you may drop a message to zliu@stern.nyu.edu or zl1011@stern.nyu.edu.
