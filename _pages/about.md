I just graduated with a Ph.D. degree in Operations Research (OR) from New York University, Stern School of Business, with a specialization in probability theory and stochastic processes. 

I am also on the job market now. 

My Ph.D. research was motivated by queueing theory in Operations Research, but it revolves around probability theory/stochastic processes and is related to differential geometry. From an applied perspective, my  Ph.D. research applies to Operations Research, Machine Learning/Deep Learning. 

Mathematically, the center of my Ph.D. training is in probability theory, with its applications in Operations Research (OR); with courses taken on both the track for Ph.D. in probability at NYU Courant and the track for Ph.D. in OR at NYU Stern. Probability theory goes through my research interests, but I am also driven to uncover the hidden connections from the probability theory to other disciplines; as well as the mathematical principles hidden behind many exciting works in other fields in the applied research, for which I aim to provide solutions or theory on the fundamental level to understand the observed phenomenon in the research of applied sciences, by leveraging the tools including the (broad) probability theory, stochastic processes, and methods of global analysis on manifolds.

My training background is, a Ph.D. in OR, specializing in probability theory (New York University, United States); M.S. in mathematical sciences, specializing in probability theory (New York University, United States); M.S. in mathematical sciences, specializing in differential geometry-global analysis on manifold (Nankai University, China); B.S. in pure mathematics (Nankai University, China).
