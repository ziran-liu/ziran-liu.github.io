This course is designed for the mathematics major undergraduate students at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. This is equivalent to the “Honors Analysis” in other names, it covers the whole set of real analysis and begins part of the Fourier analysis at the end of the semester. There was no textbook for this course. The job of this course assistant included organizing lecture notes, creating problem sets for exams and grading homeworks and exams. The students always found it hard to understand the in class material due to the density of knowledge and the limit of class time, because this course was taught in discretion of the instructor professor’s preference and understanding of this subject, for example, the Lebesgue integral was defined and constructed in an equivalent but not traditional way like in the most of the textbooks, just to make it more quickly to get to the final construction of the Lebesgue integral. In this case, the notes for the class should include the advances of the professor’s construction, as well as cutting the steps into smaller pieces, and possibly proving the equivalence of such way of construction to other traditional ones in most textbooks, if needed.
