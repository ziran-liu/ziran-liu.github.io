This course is designed as a main option for undergraduate students interested in operations research and its business applications. I taught this course as the instructor during the 2019 Summer, at NYU Leonard N. Stern School of Business. This summer course is an intense version of this subject because the same coverage of the course material, as well as studentâ€™s homework, have to be finished in half of the time of a normal semester. So it requires the instructor to work in a doubled load of teaching. Working as an instructor, I recruited my teaching assistant through the help of the academic secretary to grade the homework and exams. I like to put all the times of exams and the scope of it very early in the stage of the course, so that students can maximally schedule their time and accommodate to avoid the complications and troubles running up to a soon-to-take exam.
